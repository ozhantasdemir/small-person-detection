# Small Person Detection

Person detection plays a crucial role in various computer vision applications, ranging from surveillance
systems to rapid response in emergency situations. The widespread use of drone and helicopter
imagery in human rescue operations necessitates the development of effective techniques to detect
individuals within these images. However, detecting tiny people in such images presents numerous
challenges due to factors such as limited visual details, scale variations, occlusion, background clutter,
and varying lighting conditions. This project aims to address the specific problem of tiny person
detection.
